## General info
One of the very dangerous attacks that an adversary can perform is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. A CSRF attack allows the adversary to perform unwanted actions on
a web application in which a user is currently authenticated.CSRF attacks bring the most damage when executed by a logged user (especially an admin).To summarize we have to:
* Create a web application where the user can authenticate;
* Implement CSRF protection for your web application;
* Prove the effectiveness of implemented mechanisms (via video)
